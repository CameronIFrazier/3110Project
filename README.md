GROUP NAME: Chicken Tenders

NAMES:

  Nicholas Perez (github user : pokeysnake)
      - Tasks Completed: Entire NFA including the floating point extra credit (NFA for steps 1-3 on canvas)

  Cameron Frazier (github user : CameronIFrazier)
      - Tasks Completed: Synthesis and optimization of steps 1-2 in Python for our team's finalized submission, attempt at step 3 for floating points extra credit

  Jake Peterson (github user: GioSivo)
      - Tasks Completed: Step 1 implementation in Python, which the team was able to use as a rough draft and improve upon

  Jeffrey Hoang (github user: JeffreyHoang)
      - Tasks Completed: Implementation of first 2 steps in Java, which the team was able to use as a rough draft to expand upon
      
DISCLAIMER: 3rdtry.py was a version of trying to implement the extra credit float section of the project. It didn't work like an NFA, and was made entirely out of if statments so it wasn't used in the finalized version. The version of the code conating our actual literal checker (the first two steps of the project for a combined total of 100 points) is the file transitiontable.py.
